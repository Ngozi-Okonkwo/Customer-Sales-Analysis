## How I Transformed Raw Data into Impact Using Microsoft Excel

**Who says Excel is just for tables and formulas?**

In my recent project—part of the Microsoft Excel course by **Dahel Techies**—I worked with a raw customer dataset and turned it into insights that could shape real business decisions.

## Step 1: Data Exploration

I started with the basics:
- **Rows:** 17,422  
- **Columns:** 10  
- **Revenue Range:** £2.53 – £5,398  
- **Total Revenue:** £21.76M+  
- **Average Revenue per Order:** £1,249.26  

Beyond the numbers, I scanned for patterns, outliers, and data quality issues.

**Key Challenge:**  
The `country` column included both valid countries and regional descriptors like `"Northeast"`, `"Southwest"`, etc.

**Solution:**  
I created a new `region` column, moved all regional entries there, and standardized the country names. Clean data is the foundation of great analysis—and this simple step improved overall consistency.

## 🛠️ Step 2: Data Preparation

Once the data was cleaner, I got to work:
- Extracted **Year** and **Month** from order dates  
- Derived **Day of the Week** to analyze shopping behavior  
- Standardized customer names  
- Calculated **Customer Age at Purchase**  
- Grouped customers into **Age Bands**: Young Adults, Adults, Seniors, Elderly  
- Segmented customer value based on spending patterns  

This prep work laid the groundwork for deeper analysis.

## 📊 Step 3: Analysis & Visualization

### Top Countries by Revenue
- **Australia:** £7M+  
- **UK:** £2.86M  
- **Germany:** £2.49M  
- **France:** £2.24M  
- **Canada:** £1.07M  

### Revenue by Gender
- **Females:** £10M  
- **Males:** £11.7M  

*The split was fairly balanced, with males slightly ahead.*

### Revenue by Age Group
- **Adults:** £10.3M  
- **Seniors:** £7.6M

To bring the data to life, I visuallised:
- Revenue by Country  withe the use of a **bar chart**
- Revenue by gender using a **pie charts**  
- **Clustered column chart** to show revenue by gender of each country

## 💡 Business Recommendations
